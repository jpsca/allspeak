Organize large I18n dictionary files in Rails

If you're suffering from a huge de.yml or similiar file, cry no more. Rails lets you freely organize your dictionary files in config/locales.

My organization works like this:


config/locales/rails.de.yml # modified Rails boilerplate from https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails%2Flocale

config/locales/faker.de.yml # modified Faker boilerplate from https://github.com/stympy/faker/tree/master/lib/locales

config/locales/models.de.yml # model names, attribute names, assignable_value labels

config/locales/views.de.yml # text in the GUI

config/locales/de.yml # various one liners that don't really fit anywhere else yet.


extract lines to separate files as you see clusters of translations emerging.

--------
Note that Rails really doesn't care if the name of the locale (e.g. de or en) appears in the file. Since the root node of each YAML tree is the locale code, it can just merge all files together.
