# AllSpeak

AllSpeak is a pythonic (yet ironically inspired by Rails) i18n/l10n solution for Python web applications.  It's flexible, easy to use and —unlike _gettext_— independent of any external compilation tool.

The library is MIT Licensed and compatible with Werkzeug, Webob and Django request objects, so you can use it with pretty much any WSGI-based framework.
