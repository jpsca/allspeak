Allspeak

.. container:: lead

    AllSpeak is a pythonic (yet ironically inspired by Rails) internationalization and localization (i18n/l10n for short) solution for humans. It's flexible, easy to use and —unlike gettext— independent of any external compilation tool.


How can the translator of your multi-language web application update a text? Compiling `.po` files for a web app, really? How the Rails community solved that problem? Translations in `yaml` or `json` files. With Python it should be that simple. **Now it is**.

And the files used by Allspeak are compatible with those of Rails, so you can use any third-party service already compatible with them (for example, `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_).
