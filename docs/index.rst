    *Allspeak* is a pythonic (yet ironically inspired by Rails) internationalization and localization solution for humans.

    It's flexible, easy to use and, unlike gettext, independent of any external compilation tool.


How can the translator of your multi-language web application update a text? Compiling `.po` files for a web app, really? How the Rails community solved that problem? Translations in `yaml` files. With Python *it should* be that simple. **Now it is**.

And the files used by Allspeak are compatible with those of Rails, so you can use any third-party service already compatible with them (for example, `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_).

It is powered by the `Babel <http://babel.pocoo.org/>`_ and `pytz <http://pythonhosted.org/pytz/>`_ libraries and tested with Python 2.7, 3.3+ and pypy.
